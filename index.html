    <h1><span>"Healthy Food‚Äù </span>Defined</h1>
    <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic non-communicable
        diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Eating foods and consuming less salt, sugars, and
        saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for a healthy diet.</p>
