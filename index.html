            <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic
                non-communicable
                diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Eating foods and consuming less salt, sugars, and
                saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for a healthy diet.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>"I used to think the skills my mother and grandmother had were small and insignificant because the world
                taught me that black food was small and insignificant. But now I realize what we contribute to food in
                America is vast. Right now that’s all I want to cook, and I want to cook it on a level that resonates
                with me, beyond whether it tastes good.”</p>

                <h2>Best Grilled Chicken Breast</h2>
                <p>Grilled chicken breasts can be the epitome of boring. Too often they're dried out or rubbery. But
                    when soaked in a super-quick marinade with balsamic, brown sugar, and dried thyme you're guaranteed
                    deliciousness. Not to mention, grilling the breasts will lock in all those amazing flavors while
                    providing some serious char.</p>

                <h2>Chicken Teriyaki</h2>
                <p>Think teriyaki is just a sauce? Think again! Teriyaki is actually a cooking technique originating in
                    Japan, involving boiling or broiling meat or seafood with a sweet and salty soy glaze.</p>

                <h2>Copycat Chipotle Chicken</h2>
                <p>We love a good copycat recipe and this one is spot on. The chipotle pepper and adobo sauce gives that
                    authentic Chipotle taste we long for. </p>
